This software is a project of two students from the University of Málaga (Spain). The application simulates all the memory hierarchy of a MIPS processor, including a basic functionality of the Operating System to control page table.
The application can simulate up to three cache levels, including the possibility of have separate hierarchies for data and instructions.
This proyect is already finished, but we will continue adding new functionality, improving performance and fixing bugs.
The purpose of this proyect is educational and could be used to know how the processor works internally.

The GUI is only in spanish, but it will be in english soon.
